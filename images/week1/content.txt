✦ What is Big-O(log n)?

Big-O(log n) represents algorithms whose time complexity grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size.
Instead of checking every element, the dataset is repeatedly reduced (often halved) until the solution is found.

✦ Purpose

➤ Optimize performance and reduce unnecessary operations
➤ Scale efficiently with very large datasets
➤ Deliver faster solutions compared to linear approaches

✦ Use Cases

➤ Searching in sorted datasets (Binary Search)
➤ Balanced tree operations (BST, AVL, Red-Black Trees)
➤ Heap insertion and deletion
➤ Divide & Conquer algorithms (merge sort, quicksort in best/average cases)

✦ Professional Developer Perspective

➤ Efficiency over simplicity – log n solutions shine when datasets grow large
➤ Structured data required – most log n methods assume sorted or organized inputs
➤ Impact of scale – small datasets may blur the difference, but at millions of records, log n means milliseconds vs seconds
➤ Pattern recognition – divide-and-conquer thinking naturally unlocks log n solutions

➤ Below, I’ve added supporting images for visualization
➤ Illustrated with JavaScript search approaches (linear vs binary search)
➤ Real-world comparisons:
  • O(n) → Checking every item in a list, one by one
  • O(log n) → Splitting the search space in half repeatedly until the target is found
